Hi,

Real-time HL7 parsing through Mirth Connect with HIPAA-compliant EMR integration is exactly what the demo covers — built a working version before reaching out: https://clinical-data-integration.vercel.app

It shows HL7 message ingestion, clinical data normalization, and an audit-ready dashboard — the parts that make this kind of MVP technically non-trivial.

Previously built MedRecord AI, a clinical data extraction pipeline that reduced chart review from hours to minutes: https://medrecord-ai-delta.vercel.app

Are your HL7 feeds coming from a single EMR or multiple sources that need normalization before they're usable?

10-minute call or I can scope the first milestone in a doc — your pick.
