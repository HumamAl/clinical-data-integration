Metric ranges realistic for mid-size health systems: 500-5,000 HL7 messages/day, channel uptime 99.2-99.9%, error rates 0.1-2%, reconciliation queues of 10-50 records pending. Edge cases: duplicate MRN entries from merged patients, message parsing failures on non-standard segment extensions, Mirth channel restarts during high-volume windows.

Real tools: Mirth Connect (open-source interface engine), Rhapsody, Iguana, Infor Cloverleaf, Azure Health Data Services, Google Cloud Healthcare API."

## Aesthetic Rationale (Expanded)

**Aesthetic**: `corporate-enterprise`
**Color**: Clinical Teal — `oklch(0.50 0.13 185)`, `--primary-h: 185`
**Radius**: `0.25rem` (sharp — signals clinical precision, not consumer friendliness)
**Motion**: 50-100ms (instant — compliance tooling, not a consumer product)
**Density**: Compact — ops teams monitoring live interfaces need maximum data visibility

The client describes a B2B healthcare operations tool built for a clinical team. This is not a patient-facing app. The framing ("regulatory and user requirements", "HIPAA", "Mirth", "HL7") confirms enterprise-grade infrastructure tooling. The Corporate Enterprise aesthetic communicates:

- Clinical trust through visual structure
- Compliance seriousness through restrained color
- Operational precision through compact density
- Institutional credibility through sharp corners and full borders

The teal color (`oklch(0.50 0.13 185)`) sits in the blue-green range used universally in healthcare software — calm, clinical, trust-building. Low chroma prevents consumer wellness associations.

## Portfolio Project Rationale

1. **MedRecord AI (#9)** — Primary: Clinical data extraction pipeline, AI document processing, medical record vocabulary. Healthcare AI with structured data extraction is the closest analog to HL7 message parsing.
2. **Southfield Healthcare (#12)** — Domain match: patient management, provider dashboards, clinical workflows. Shows operational healthcare software experience.
3. **Tinnitus Therapy SaaS (#11)** — Multi-clinic SaaS with patient management. Shows healthcare SaaS architecture pattern.
4. **WMF Agent Dashboard (#1)** — Feature overlap: automated pipeline processing, n8n integration workflows, structured data extraction. Shows integration/pipeline competence directly relevant to Mirth/HL7 work.

---

## Cover Letter Notes

**Variant C** is strongest here because MedRecord AI and Southfield Healthcare are directly relevant — the opening can lead with "recently built two healthcare systems" which is a compelling credibility hook before the demo link.

**CTO hook**: The client dropped "If goes well would open up CTO options." This is a major long-term signal. The cover letter should not ignore it — subtly acknowledging that you think architecturally (not just feature-by-feature) resonates. Do not say "CTO" in the letter — let the demo's technical depth speak to it.

**Tone calibration**: The post reads like a technical healthcare team or technical product manager. Semi-formal, requirements-focused. Not a startup founder's casual post. The tone should match: professional, technically fluent, no buzzwords.

**Embedded question candidate**: "Are patient records flowing through a single EMR or are you connecting multiple systems with different HL7 dialects?" — this shows Mirth/HL7 expertise by referencing the dialect/version nuance, which non-experts don't know about.

## Screening Answers (All Three Questions)

### Q1: Describe your recent experience with similar projects

Built MedRecord AI — a clinical document processing pipeline that extracts and structures patient data from records: https://medrecord-ai-delta.vercel.app. Also shipped Southfield Healthcare, a multi-provider ops platform. Both required the same data-structure discipline that HL7 integration demands.

*(29 words — within limit. References demo. Uses clinical vocabulary.)*

### Q2: Please list any certifications related to this project

No formal HL7 or HIPAA certifications — I focus on shipping compliant architecture: audit logging, role-based PHI access control, no PII in client-side state. The demo at {VERCEL_URL} reflects these patterns throughout.

*(33 words — honest, no exaggeration per truthfulness policy. Redirects to demo.)*

### Q3: What frameworks have you worked with?

Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js for the application layer. For healthcare specifically: HL7 v2.x message structure (ADT, ORM, ORU segments), Mirth Connect channel architecture, and REST/FHIR API patterns. Demo covers the integration workflow approach: {VERCEL_URL}

*(36 words — named their specific stack terms (Mirth, HL7, ADT/ORM/ORU). Demo link closes it.)*

## Feature Build Priorities

Listed in priority order for the Feature Builder:

1. **Message Queue** — Core operational view. Table of HL7 messages with status (Acknowledged/Failed/Quarantined), message type (ADT/ORM/ORU), source EMR, timestamp, and MRN. Filter by status, message type, date range. This is the primary daily-use screen.

2. **EMR Connections** — Interface registry showing all connected EMR systems, channel status (Active/Degraded/Failed), message volume, last heartbeat. Most important trust signal for a client evaluating an integration MVP.

3. **Audit Log** — HIPAA-critical. Paginated log of all PHI access events: user, action, MRN accessed, timestamp, IP. With date range filter. Signals HIPAA competence immediately.

4. **Channel Status** — Mirth-specific: per-channel metrics (messages in/out, error count, queue depth, uptime %). The client named Mirth explicitly — this page proves domain knowledge.

5. **Reconciliation Queue** — Patient records flagged for manual review (duplicate MRN, missing fields, failed transform). Status filter + assignee + action buttons.

## Dashboard Composition Notes

For the Dashboard Builder — this is B2B healthcare ops, not a patient portal. Compose like Epic's system status view or an integration monitoring dashboard:

- **Top KPI row** (6 compact stat cards): Messages Today, Channel Uptime %, Error Rate, Pending Reconciliation, Active Interfaces, HIPAA Events (24h)
- **Message volume area chart** — 30-day trend with ADT/ORM/ORU series breakdown
- **Channel status grid** — compact card grid, one per EMR connection (Epic, Cerner, etc.) showing uptime, last heartbeat, error count
- **Recent errors/alerts table** — last 10 failed messages with type, source, and error reason
- **Bottom banner** — "This is a live demo built for your clinical integration project" with links to /challenges and /proposal

Avoid: patient lists, scheduling calendars, appointment views. This is infrastructure tooling, not clinical workflow tooling.
